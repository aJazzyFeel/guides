## DDoS Denial of Service Attack

You might have heard about this one on the news before or even witnessed a website go down firsthand. **DDoS** is the abbreviation for **Distributed Denial of Service** attacks. Denial-of-service attacks are usually cyber-attacks where the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable by flooding the targeted machine or resource. This can be accomplished by sending huge amounts of requests over the network, very suddenly and unexpectedly. In consequence the system gets overloaded and some or all legitimate requests are prevented from being fulfilled.

### Legality
Criminal perpetrators of DoS attacks often target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such as banks or credit card payment gateways. Revenge, blackmail and activism can motivate these attacks. The legality of this is of course a big concern and often comes up in debate.
